\section{Introduction}

Consider the following hypothetical scenario: it is the night before the 
NIPS deadline, and you are a professor with an army of $n$ graduate students, 
each of whom has written a paper.  Some fraction, $\goodraters$, of these 
students are ``highly competent''---namely, they both produce good papers, as 
well as accurately review papers (i.e. determine whether a given paper is good 
or not).  The remaining $1-\goodraters$ fraction of your graduate students 
behave arbitrarily---some of them might still produce great papers, and some 
might still give accurate reviews.  Of course, as the professor, you are also 
capable of accurately reviewing papers.  You want to choose a large subset of 
the students' papers to submit to NIPS, at least $\goodraters n$, and you want 
to ensure that most of the submitted papers are good.  The question is how to 
choose this subset while minimizing the amount of work you do (i.e. the number 
of papers you review), as well as minimizing the number of papers you assign 
each student to review. Unfortunately, you yourself have forgotten which students 
in your lab are competent, so part of the task is to determine this.
%
Perhaps surprisingly, we show that even with an arbitrarily large number of 
students, $n$, and even if the non-competent students are all colluding to 
get their papers submitted, you can successfully accomplish this task while 
performing only a constant amount of work yourself (dependent on the fraction 
of ``highly competent'' students), and having each student only do a constant 
amount of work!

We can model this problem more precisely (as well as more generally) as follows: 
we assume that there are $m$ items and $n$ raters. We define a matrix 
$\Anom \in \{0,1\}^{n \times m}$ where $\Anom_{ij}$ denotes the rating that 
rater $i$ assigns to item $j$ ($1$ if good and $0$ if bad); in the setting above, 
the raters are graduate students and the items are papers. 
The value $\Anom_{ij}$ is observed only if rater $i$ rates item $j$. 
Similarly, we let the vector $\rtrue \in \{0,1\}^n$ denote 
our own ratings of items, which we assume are accurate; as before, 
$\rtrue_{j}$ is observed only if we rate item $j$.

We make the following assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is a set $\good$ of honest raters of size at least $\goodfrac n$, 
      such that $\Anom_i$ agrees stochastically with $\rtrue$ in the sense that 
      $\bP[\Anom_{ij} = \rtrue_j] \geq \frac{2}{3}$ for all $i \in \sC$ and 
      $j \in [m]$, and furthermore the $\Anom_{ij}$ are independent.
\item For the dishonest raters, $\Anom_{ij}$ can be chosen adversarially, 
      with full knowledge of which ratings everyone was assigned and how the 
      honest users behaved, and in collusion with all of the other 
      dishonest raters.
\end{enumerate}
Assuming that there are at least $\beta m$ good items, our goal is to obtain 
a set $T \subseteq [m]$ of size $\beta m$, such that 
$\frac{1}{\beta m} \sum_{j \in T} \rtrue_j \geq 1-\epsilon$.
The reults of this paper imply that we can do this with minimal work per rater:
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:main-1}
Suppose that each rater is assigned $k$ items to rate at random, and that we rate 
$k_0$ items at random. Then, assuming that $k \geq \Omega\p{\frac{1}{\alpha^3\beta\epsilon^4} + \frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha\beta\epsilon^2}}$, and 
$k_0 \geq \Omega\p{\frac{\log(1/\alpha\delta)}{\alpha\beta\epsilon^2}}$, 
with probability $1-\delta$ we can recover a set $T$ of size $\gooditems m$, 
such that $\frac{1}{\gooditems m} \sum_{j \in T} \rtrue_j \geq 1-\epsilon$.
\end{theorem}
The main computational step in the recovery algorithm involves solving a 
nuclear-norm constrained optimization problem (where all of the remaining 
constraints are linear inequalities).

Beyond the professorial scenario above, our setting encompasses many increasingly 
important applied problems, which we describe below.

\paragraph{Crowdsourcing}

\paragraph{Community Detection}

\paragraph{Collaborative Filtering}
We can generalize Theorem~\ref{thm:main-1} to include the setting 
where the ratings of the good users comprise an arbitrary rank-$r$ matrix (note 
that our previous assumptions implied that $M_{\sC}$ had rank $1$).

%This setup also models the challenge of crowdsourcing the creation of a large 
%dataset. While several mechanisms have been proposed for ensuring high-quality 
%data in crowdsourcing applications, most assume that there are ``gold labels'' 
%that can be used to assess worker performance during the course of 
%data collection; moreover, most mechanisms make assumptions about the behavior 
%of workers (e.g. that workers that behaved well before will continue to 
%behave well, or that they act to maximize a certain payoff function).
%In this work we are motivated by cases where there is not necessarily a single 
%correct answer --- for instance, tasks such as ``draw an interesting picture'' 
%or ``translate this sentence'', where different workers could generate different 
%equally good answers. In this case, the only way to evaluate quality is 
%via evaluation by other workers or by the manager of the experiment. 
%Moreover, since workers will often try to game the system (in order to 
%get paid), we would like to model non-cooperative workers as adversarial. 
%To formalize both of these desiderata, we adopt the following model:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item There is a manager who controls the experiment, and 
%      $N$ workers.
%\item The goal is to generate data $X \in \sX$ that satisfies 
%      a binary criterion $f : \sX \to \{0,1\}$ (e.g. $f$ could answer
%      ``Is $X$ an interesting picture?'' or ``Is $X$ a correct translation?'').
%      The manager knows $f$.
%\item Each worker $i$ can generate a datum $X_i$, as well as evaluate 
%      data with a function $f_i : \sX \to \{0,1\}$.
%\item There are $\goodraters N$ \emph{cooperative} workers, such that 
%      $f_i = f$, $f(X_i) = 1$, and the worker 
%      wants to be helpful (they will cooperate with the protocol 
%      specified by the manager).
%\item The rest of the workers could be adversarial; they could generate 
%      good data or bad data, and could output correct or incorrect evaluations. 
%      The adversaries could have knowledge of who they are.
%\end{itemize}
