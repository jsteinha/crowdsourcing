\subsection{Stability Under Noise (Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:objective-bound})}
\label{sec:objective-bound-proof}

By H\"{o}lder's inequality, we have that $|\langle \A-\Aa, M \rangle| \leq \|\A-\Aa\|_{\op}\|M\|_*$.   We now leverage Theorem~\ref{thm:le} to bound $\|\A-\Aa\|_{\op}$.  To apply the theorem, first note that from the construction of $\A$ given in Algorithm~\ref{alg:create-A}, $\A$ can be constructed by first having the raters rate each item independently with probability $k/m$ to form matrix $\A^o$ and then removing ratings from the ``heavy'' rows (i.e. rows with more than $2k$ ratings), and ``heavy'' columns (i.e. columns with more than $2k$) ratings.  By standard Chernoff bounds, the probability that a given row or column will need to be ``pruned'' is at most $e^{-k/3} \le 2/k$, and hence from the independence of the rows, the probability that more than $5n/k$ rows are ``heavy'' is at most $e^{-2n/3k}$.  The probability that there are more than $5n/k$ heavy columns is identically bounded.

 Note that the expectation of the portion of $\A^o$ corresponding to the reliable raters is exactly the corresponding portion of matrix $\Aa,$ and with probability at least $1-2e^{-2n/3k}$, at most $10 n/k$ rows and/or columns of $\A^o$ are pruned to form $\A$.  Consider padding matrices $\A$ and $\Aa$ with zeros, to form the $n \times n$ matrices $\A'$ and $\Aa'$.   With probability $1-2e^{-2n/3k}$ the conditions of Theorem~\ref{thm:le} now apply to $\A'$ and $\Aa'$, with the parameters $d = \frac{n k}{m} \le k$, and $d' =  2k$.  Hence for any $r \ge 1$, with probability at least $1-2e^{-2n/3k} -n^{-r}$ $$\|\A-\Aa\|_{\op} = \|\A'-\Aa'\|_{\op} \le C r^{3/2} \sqrt{k},$$ for some absolute constant $C$.  

By assumption, $\|\M\|_* \le \frac{2}{\alpha \eps}\sqrt{\alpha \beta n m}$ and $\|\Mm\|_* \le \frac{2}{\alpha \eps}\sqrt{\alpha \beta n m}$.   Hence setting $r= \log (1/\delta),$ and $k \ge C' \log^3(\frac{1}{\delta}) \frac{m/n}{\eps^4 \alpha^3 \beta}$ for some absolute constant $C'$, we have that with probability at least $1-\delta$, we have $$|\langle \A-\Aa, \M \rangle|  \le \frac{1}{2} \eps \alpha \beta k n,$$ and $|\langle \A-\Aa, \Mm \rangle|$ is bounded identically.

To conclude, we have the following:
\begin{align}
\langle \Aa, \M \rangle  &\geq \langle \A, \M \rangle - \frac{1}{2}\epsilon \alpha \beta k n \\
 &\geq \langle \A, \Mm \rangle - \frac{1}{2} \epsilon \alpha \beta k n \text{ (since $\M$ is optimal for $\A$)} \\
 &\geq \langle \Aa, \Mm \rangle - \epsilon \alpha \beta k n,
\end{align}
which completes the proof.
