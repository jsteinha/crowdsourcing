\subsection{Correctness of Randomized Rounding (Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:rounding})}
\label{sec:rounding-proof}

Our goal is to show that the output of 
Algorithm~\ref{alg:round} satisfies $\bE[T] = T_0$. First, observe that 
since $(T_0)_j \leq 1$ for all $j$, each interval $[s_{j-1},s_j)$ has length 
at most $1$, and so the for loop over $z$ never picks the same index $j$ 
twice. Moreover, the probability that $j$ is included in $T_0$ is exactly 
$s_j - s_{j-1} = (T_0)_j$. The result follows by linearity of expectation.
