We consider a crowdsourcing model in which a fraction $\goodraters$ of 
workers can both generate high-quality data and correctly evaluate 
the quality of data, while the remaining workers may behave arbitrarily and 
possibly adversarially. 
There is no ground truth on which to evaluate worker quality, but the 
manager of the experiment can manually evaluate the quality of 
a given datum. Given $N$ workers, we wish to curate a dataset 
of size $\Omega(\goodraters N)$, with at most an $\error$ fraction of 
low-quality data.  Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this is possible with an 
amount of work required of the manager, and each worker, that does not scale 
with $N$; specifically, we show that such a dataset can be curated with
$\oo\p{\frac{1}{\goodraters^4\error^4}}$ 
work per worker, and $\oo\p{\frac{\log(1/\goodraters)}{\goodraters^2\error^2}}$ 
work for the manager.
