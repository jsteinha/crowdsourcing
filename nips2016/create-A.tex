\begin{algorithm}[b!]
\caption{Algorithm for obtaining (unreliable) ratings matrix $\A$.}
\label{alg:create-A}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Input: number of raters $n$,  number of items $m$, and ratings per rater $k$.
\State Initially assign each rater to each item independently probability $k/2m$.  
\State For every rater assigned more than $k$ items, un-assign items until 
       there are $k$ remaining.
\State For every item assigned to more than $k$
       raters, un-assign raters until there are $k$ remaining.
\State Have the raters submit ratings of their assigned items, and let $\A$ 
       denote the resulting matrix of ratings with missing entries fill in with 
       zeros.
