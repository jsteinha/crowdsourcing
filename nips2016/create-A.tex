\caption{Algorithm for obtaining (unreliable) ratings matrix $\A$ and noisy 
ratings $\robs$, $\robs'$.}
\label{alg:create-A}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Input: number of raters $n$,  number of items $m$, and ratings per rater $k$.
\State Initially assign each rater to each item independently with probability $k/m$.  
\State For each rater with more than $2k$ items, arbitrarily unassign items until 
       there are $2k$ remaining.
\State For each item with more than $2k$
       raters, arbitrarily unassign raters until there are $2k$ remaining.
\State Have the raters submit ratings of their assigned items, and let $\A$ 
       denote the resulting matrix of ratings with missing entries fill in with 
       zeros.
%\State Generate each of $\robs$ and $\robs'$ by rating items with probability $\frac{k_0}{m}$ (fill in missing entries with zeros)
\State Generate $\robs$ by rating items with probability $\frac{k_0}{m}$ (fill in missing entries with zeros)
\State Output $\A$, $\robs$%, and $\robs'$
\end{algorithmic}
